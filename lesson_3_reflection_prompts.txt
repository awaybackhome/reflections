When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you have to change workstations or when working with others.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's a way to stay more organized in module form. Although git commit should
    do this for you, you wouldn't want your workspace being modified by others
    while you work on something.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is an easy way to start working on someone's rep on github as your own. You
    would clone someone's rep on github first. Then you would make it your remote in git.
    You could then work on the forked clone as your own.

    Branches are commits that divide off from the master. Branches are kind of like forks,
    but in a conceptually larger way. A branch is used to break off from the master and
    for ex. work on your own idea. The same can be said for a fork. If you clone a rep, but
    are not allowed to work on it. You can work on your forked clone aside from the original
    author's. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Not only can you see what others have added, you can merge that into your master and
    update the remote origin. It can also show you how much progress has been made since,
    you personally worked on the repository.

and what would be harder?
