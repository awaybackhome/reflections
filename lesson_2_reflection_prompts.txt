What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When you initialize a repository, you are activating it as a git
	repository. However, this does that mean any files are being tracked
	at this point. This just means, you have created a working directory.
	Without initialization, you will not be able, however, to
	track commits ie -- add commits to your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is an area where you can select certain files you want
	to include in the commit that will be sent to the repository.
	This differs from the working area where you see and interact with the files
	in a directory. Not all files need to be tracked and thus removed from the 
	repository or commit in git. If you were to clone the git, only the files that
	made it to the staging area would be included. This offers more control and
	organization over what you with to commit.
